The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting 
the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. 
First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. 
Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. 
There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, 
the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

# you will get pvt key
