There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: 
it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. 
It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the 
previous level (bandit20). 
If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).


ssh -p 2220 bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

# Terminal1- start the nc -l
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20 | nc -lp 6000

# Terminal2 connect to the port using setuid file
./suconnect 6000
